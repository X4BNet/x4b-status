We will be conducting some minor maintenance in London this afternoon. No interruption is expected however as always when work is being carried out there is a small chance of issue. Due to this we are conducting this maintenance outside of UK peak hours.

*Update* Maintenance is proceeding well. End time has been revised to reflect some expected delays.

*Update* Maintenance complete. Minor interruption did occur towards the end. Procedure has been updated to prevent this in future executions of this plan.
