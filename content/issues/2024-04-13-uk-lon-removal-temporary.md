We are temporarily removing LON1 from the anycast mix due to recurring issues with a fa﻿iling switch.


U﻿pstream techs have assured us the replacement switch is on its way however to prevent further short disruptions we are removing the location temporarily.

R﻿outes to LON will be restored once the new switch is installed.
