*﻿Update* - At long last upstream has resolved the issue.

"One of the edge routers encountered issues due to a firmware bug. detecting the issue was challenging as no logs were generated, due to the router running outdated firmware. the issue was resolved by updating the RE code and rebooting the router."

R﻿outes to LA have been restored.

*Investigating* - We have been investigating some issues this month in LA upstream. While we wait / work on resolution we have pulled routes from the region.

W﻿e will return routes once the situation is resolved.
