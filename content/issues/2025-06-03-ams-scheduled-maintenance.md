Our upstream datacenter has notified us today of upcoming maintenance in Amsterdam.



Network engineers will be upgrading top-of-rack switches and reworking some of the network topologies for a more robust and stable overall network in the server cabinet.


Though the outage is not expected to last more than 5 to 10 minutes, the work window will be longer as our team will test and ensure connectivity is stable before completing the maintenance.
