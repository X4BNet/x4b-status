*Update* Currently waiting on upstream technicians to do their side. We are hoping for everything to be done tonight.

*Update* We are still working on this. Currently running behind schedule. Hoping to have this done by 7pm tonight.

Upstream has requested that we move our hardware to a new area of the datacenter. To facilitate that we are going to experience an interruption. We have been requested to do this via a system migration.

To facilitate this we will be taking Singapore routes down from midday AEST on Wednesday. We estimate that it will take 4-5 hours to complete.
