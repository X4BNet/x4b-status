O﻿ur server will be getting physically moved to a new section of the datacenter between these dates. This will help us combat issues observed over the past few months including:

﻿- Increased temperature within the cage our server is in

﻿- Replacement of a failing switch (this has been responsible for a few 5-10s per week interruptions over the past month)

E﻿xpected interuption is likely just a couple hours, however depending on when we get scheduled we may restrict routes before / after depending on the availability of our technicians to verify / prepare. We are relying on remote hands and a significant number of servers are being moved during this time so we do not at this stage know our exact time.

W﻿e will aim to revise the scheduled time however to reduce the range closer to the event.
