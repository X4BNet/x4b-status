We will be upgrading our network capacity and filtering hardware in Amsterdam. Any customers who have configured a HA type setup will be largely unaffected as routes will be removed from the region at-least 10 minutes before start of maintenance and traffic redirected to London and Ashburn PoPs.

We expect the total maintenance to take approx 1-hour.

*Update* - Maintenance taking a little longer than expected. Routes will be restored to Amsterdam as soon as possible.

*Update* - Routes have been restored, final finishing of tasks continues in the background with no expected interruption.

*Update* - Final checks complete. If you are experiencing any issues please don't hesitate to contact us.
