We are aware of some instability in the region. When contacted our upstream confirmed it and that it was resolved. It doesnt seem to be resolved.

We have hence pulled our routes from the region.


*Update* upstream has reported that everything has normalized and we have obersved the same. We are restoring Dallas routes.
