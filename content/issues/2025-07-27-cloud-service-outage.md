Upstream currently has an outage affecting their US-EAST PoP where our core cloud (web panel, data collection, etc) is homed. This does not affect customer services are all essential services (BGP, route validation, mitigation analysis) is multi-homed. Email delivery (i.e on DDoS attack) will not be available until service restored.

"Investigating - Our team is investigating an emerging service issue affecting All Services in US-EAST (Newark). We will share additional updates as we have more information."
