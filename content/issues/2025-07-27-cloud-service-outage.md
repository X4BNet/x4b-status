Upstream Update - 
Our SMEs continue to work bringing our services back online, and we will provide an update as progress is made.

Upstream Update - 
Identified - Our team has identified the issue affecting connectivity in our US-EAST (Newark) data center. The issue is related to heating/cooling complications in the data center due to a power outage . The power outage has been fixed and we are working quickly to bring our services back online, and we will provide an update as soon as the solution is in place.

Upstream currently has an outage affecting their US-EAST PoP where our core cloud (web panel, data collection, etc) is homed. This does not affect customer services are all essential services (BGP, route validation, mitigation analysis) is multi-homed. Email delivery (i.e on DDoS attack) will not be available until service restored.

"Investigating - Our team is investigating an emerging service issue affecting All Services in US-EAST (Newark). We will share additional updates as we have more information."
