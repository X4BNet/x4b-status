We will be performing system upgrades on Wednesday. No interruption is expected.

Systems will be done in parallel in groups with an estimated total risk of interruption period per server of 30 minutes.

This is the same upgrade that was carried out on the budget line last week without interruption.

If any interruption or unexpected event occurs we will update this incident.
