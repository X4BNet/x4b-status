*Investigating* - Still yet to receive any solution from Paypal.

Transactions are being manually processed in a priority queue. Open a support ticket if you need manual processing urgently.

We are working on a temporary solution to reduce the delay to ~5-10 minutes while we wait on a fix from Paypal.

*Investigating* - We are aware of delays processing paypal payments. We have contacted Paypal merchant support for a fix and are awaiting a response.

If you need a payment manually processed open a support ticket including a screenshot of your payment and we will get to it ASAP.
