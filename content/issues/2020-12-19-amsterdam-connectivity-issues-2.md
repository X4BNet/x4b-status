*Investigating* - It appears that the Emergency maintenance performed by upstream to resolve Amsterdam: Connectivity Issues (2) has not been suvvessful in resolving the ToR stability issue. We have seen what appears to be a similar interuption. We have pulled routes again and await upstream response.

*Investigating* - CPU spikes on upstream ToR switch. They have made some adjustments and continue to monitor. We have restored routes.

*Fixed* - Upstream reports fixed. We will continue to monitor closely over the next few days however.
