*Update* No interruotions today. Upstream really messed up communication on this one. They will be emailing everyone over the next couple of days at which time we will know more. The next couple of days may have some network noise but is generally expected to be fine.

*Update*. No information currently from upstream. Will leave open as more interruptions are posssible during the night.

*Update* Appears down again.

*Update* Upstream reports resolved through early moving our hardware to Switzerland.

Luxembourg network issues affecting Budget Line Luxembourg services currently.

No information currently on the cause or status.

Services will return online when upstream resolves.
