On Tuesday afternoon we will be moving our web panel and database to new upgraded servers. This will consist of approximately 1 hour of panel and site outage (maintenance page) and up to 1 hour of partial ouage (dry run mode) while we complete manual tests on all components and services. During this time any customer service changes requested will be queued for execution on completion.

We appologies for any inconvenience this may cause.

We will update this status announcement as appropriate with updates.
