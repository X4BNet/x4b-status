*Investigating* - We are investigating a potential issue that might affect the uptime of one our of services. We are sorry for any inconvenience this may cause you. This incident post will be updated once we have more information.

*Update* from upstream "I apologize for the trouble, one of our virtual chassis switches was having problems routing packets, so all packets were being split causing 50/50 delivery, so to clear this problem along with applying changes I rebooted the problematic switch. The issue should be fixed and as well redundant routing is now active."
