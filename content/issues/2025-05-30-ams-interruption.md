*Update* Hardware has been replaced upstream and we have restored routes. Sorry for any interruption over the past 5 minutes we had a limited window for restoration while under the eye of upstream NOC today.

*Update* Upstream confirms that the issue is taking longer than expected to resolve. We continue to route around the issue.

Upstream has confirmed an interruption in AMS affecting firewalled TCP traffic. We have pulled routes from the region until incident confirmed over.
