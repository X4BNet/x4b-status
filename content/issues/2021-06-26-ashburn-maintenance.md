*Update* Update not going as smoothly as planned. However there should be no further updates. Further information to follow once upgrade is complete.

*Update* We will be starting maintenance shortly. We expect minimal interuption. It is however possible some connections will be interrupted near the start and end of the maintenance. As always we will do our best to limit interruptions.

We are planning to conduct a hardware upgrade during off-peak in Ashburn. Exact time is currently being scheduled with local technicians. We will update this entry with more information when we get scheduling confirmation.
