**Update** It finally happened, it was a saga, but london Lumen has finally been lit.

We are currently in the process of onboarding our new (replacement) transit provider Lumen (formerly Level3). Originally lit only for APAC and South America Lumen transit has now been lit for US and EU PoPs with one exception.



W﻿e are currently waiting on transit availability in London (Globalswitch). Due to the close pysical location and significant advantage in lighting Lumen accross EU and US at this time we have opted to proceed before London is ready.



T﻿he current ETA for London's lumen transit is "a few weeks".
