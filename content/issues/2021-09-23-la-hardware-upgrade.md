We will be performing maintenance in L.A on Monday and Tuesday to upgrade the hardware we have deployed in the region.

We will endeavour to keep interruption to a minimum by removing the PoP before and during major works. We expect to be able to perform this maintenance within 1-2 hours.

We will uppdate this announcement with further information when available.
