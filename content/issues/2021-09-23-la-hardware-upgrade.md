**Update** Routes are up. We will observe closely for any issues. Please do open a support ticket if you notice anything we don't.

**Update** Maintenance is proceeding roughly on schedule. We expect to be complete in 15-30 minutes.

**Update** Maintenance is begining now


We will be performing maintenance in L.A on Monday and Tuesday to upgrade the hardware we have deployed in the region.

We will endeavour to keep interruption to a minimum by removing the PoP before and during major works. We expect to be able to perform this maintenance within 1-2 hours.

We will update this announcement with further information when available.
