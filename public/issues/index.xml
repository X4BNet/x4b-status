        <description>It is expected that maintenance will take approximately 1 hour per server. No interruption is expected however risk does exist. We will be updating a couple servers at a time.
There is the chance that we will need to do the update of some servers the following day. However the plan is to get all the servers done in one day if possible.
This is the same update that has already been performed on the budget line.</description>

        <description>We are depreciating Recaptcha &amp;amp; recaptcha fallback for validation pages. Currently recaptcha is in use for less than 0.01% of all verification page requests so far in 2025 and with the exception of an attack utilizing a captcha solver (a growing risk that will be mitigated by removal) was similarly represented in 2024.
If any customer requires a no-javascript verification page they may contact us and we will see what we can do, however its our current belief given the analytics gathered from user agents and usage of the default PoW verification system that this is below a significant number.</description>

Update We currently await Akamai to fix their internal networking. 4/12 of our cluster nodes are currently online. The panel is up but slow. Some non essential services that rely on inter-node communication are degraded.
Update Panel is currently very slow due to 70% of cloud nodes being offline currently.</description>

Our SMEs continue to work bringing our services back online, and we will provide an update as progress is made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upstream Update -
Identified - Our team has identified the issue affecting connectivity in our US-EAST (Newark) data center. The issue is related to heating/cooling complications in the data center due to a power outage . The power outage has been fixed and we are working quickly to bring our services back online, and we will provide an update as soon as the solution is in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upstream currently has an outage affecting their US-EAST PoP where our core cloud (web panel, data collection, etc) is homed. This does not affect customer services are all essential services (BGP, route validation, mitigation analysis) is multi-homed. Email delivery (i.e on DDoS attack) will not be available until service restored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Investigating - Our team is investigating an emerging service issue affecting All Services in US-EAST (Newark). We will share additional updates as we have more information.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

Investigating - Issue seems to have been limited to 13/37k certificates we generate. We beleive this was caused by an increase in errors due to a large number of bad certificate generations being attempted.
We have made some changes and are monitoring. Please let us know if you have any issues.

        <description>Our upstream datacenter has notified us today of upcoming maintenance in Amsterdam.
Network engineers will be upgrading top-of-rack switches and reworking some of the network topologies for a more robust and stable overall network in the server cabinet.
Though the outage is not expected to last more than 5 to 10 minutes, the work window will be longer as our team will test and ensure connectivity is stable before completing the maintenance.</description>

Update Pulling network routes.
Upstream network is performing maintenance on our network slice. We will take this time to do some long delayed network configuration changes brining this location into sync with other locations configuration.
We expect 15 minutes of interruption in Dallas during this time. We will pull routes from the region in advance of the maintenance. We will update on status here.

        <description>Update - Still yet to receive any solution from Paypal. Only an acknowledgement of suspected fault on their end.
We are processing payments through our workaround as per normal. However there is still some element of unknown until paypal resolve the actual issue (which appears to be issues specifically with our x4b.net domain name)
As this issue does not have any known customer impact we are going to bring it to a close now.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Should you experience any delayed payments (either immeidately, or after 3 hours when the new correlation script can recover any missed payments) via paypal let us know and we will sort it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update&lt;/em&gt; - Still yet to receive any solution from Paypal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Transaction log check job remains in place. Having discovered a suspected workaround to the Paypal IPN system bug have implemented a workaround that appears to enable IPNs to be sent again. We will continue to run both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update&lt;/em&gt; - Still yet to receive any solution from Paypal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have implemented a payment check job which is able to import payments made once they are available via Paypal REST api (up to 3 hours). We understand this is inconvenient however at this time it is what we have available to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paypal&amp;rsquo;s IPN system has abruptly stopped communicating with us and we await a serious response from Paypal on this matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stripe (Credit Card) and Crypto payments are unaffected. If you need to make an urgent payment we strongly recommend using Stripe until this matter can be resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Investigating&lt;/em&gt; - Still yet to receive any solution from Paypal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transactions are being manually processed in a priority queue. Open a support ticket if you need manual processing urgently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are working on a temporary solution to reduce the delay to ~5-10 minutes while we wait on a fix from Paypal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Investigating&lt;/em&gt; - We are aware of delays processing paypal payments. We have contacted Paypal merchant support for a fix and are awaiting a response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need a payment manually processed open a support ticket including a screenshot of your payment and we will get to it ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O﻿ur server will be getting physically moved to a new datacenter between these dates. This will help us combat issues observed over the past few months including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;﻿- Increased temperature within the cage our server is in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;﻿- Replacement of a failing switch (this has been responsible for a few 5-10s per week interruptions over the past month)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E﻿xpected interuption is likely just a couple hours, however depending on when we get scheduled we may restrict routes before / after depending on the availability of our technicians to verify / prepare. We are relying on remote hands and a significant number of servers are being moved during this time so we do not at this stage know our exact time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;W﻿e will aim to revise the scheduled time however to reduce the range closer to the event.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>﻿Update** LON1 is being restored to the mix. Upstream techs have been able to repair the existing switch (replaced fan). We have monitored the switch for the past 48-hours after fan replacement and has been reliable.
&amp;ldquo;We observed that the onsite fans were ineffective, but the replacement fan we dispatched has proven successful. At present, the switch seems to be operating reliably, and we&amp;rsquo;ve been actively monitoring its performance.&amp;quot;</description>

&lt;p&gt;We are temporarily removing LON1 from the anycast mix due to recurring issues with a fa﻿iling switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U﻿pstream techs have assured us the replacement switch is on its way however to prevent further short disruptions we are removing the location temporarily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R﻿outes to LON will be restored once the new switch is installed.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>U﻿pstream Incident Report -
Short version:
Networks&amp;rsquo; been crapping itself for the past day. After 2 - 3 hard failures today we did an emergency JunOS downgrade and are cautiously optimistic that it&amp;rsquo;s resolved.
Longer/technical version:
For the past month or so we&amp;rsquo;ve been suffering a weird issue where random IP addresses would stop responding. The issue is that our router would lose/expire out the ARP entry for these IP addresses and wouldn&amp;rsquo;t attempt to learn them again unless forced to.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Short version:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Networks&amp;rsquo; been crapping itself for the past day. After 2 - 3 hard failures today we did an emergency JunOS downgrade and are cautiously optimistic that it&amp;rsquo;s resolved.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Longer/technical version:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
For the past month or so we&amp;rsquo;ve been suffering a weird issue where random IP addresses would stop responding. The issue is that our router would lose/expire out the ARP entry for these IP addresses and wouldn&amp;rsquo;t attempt to learn them again unless forced to.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
No amount of traffic getting sent to the IP externally (pings, random connection attempts, etc) would make the router issue an ARP &amp;ldquo;who-has&amp;rdquo; message. The only fix was to either ping the IP on the LAN (through our speedtest page for instance), forcing the router to see the ARP message on the network, or to login to the router and ping from there.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
No amount of limits, tweaks, process restarts, etc, has helped with this. The only way to date has been the above methods.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This morning we had an issue where all users on 209.141.x.x dropped offline. These subnets had been moved down to our new Cisco core switch to help resolve the issue. Our Juniper router dropped the ARP entry for the Cisco switch, killing BGP. After some time it re-learned then entry reestablished connectivity, bringing those subnets back online.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This happened three times in the past 24 hours, each outage lasting anywhere from 5 minutes to 30 minutes.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Las Vegas is the only location suffering this issue. The key difference between all locations being that Vegas was running JunOS 20.4, where as everywhere else is 18.2~4. In JunOS 20.x they made changes to ARP to allow policing. While we did change this policy, it didn&amp;rsquo;t help us any.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
As of an hour ago we performed a downgrade to JunOS 18.4. It obviously went terribly. After some research we found the configuration entry causing issues (our 100G ports kept channelizing) and fixed it, bringing things back online.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
As of now, ARP&amp;rsquo;s are resolving near instantaneously, even for new IP addresses. We took this as a good time to change the rest of our ports to 100G, giving us a 400Gbit interlink between our router and core switch.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
We&amp;rsquo;re cautiously optimistic that this issue is now resolved.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
We thank you for your patience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-﻿-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U﻿pstream reports that it is conducting emergency maintenance to downgrade the router firmware in an attempt to resolve issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-﻿&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O﻿ffline again, ticket has been sent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-﻿&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U﻿pstream restored services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T﻿he underlying issue (router bug) is still under investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-﻿&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vegas upstream is offline. We have ticketed them and contacted staff members. We await response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We apologize about the short notice (again).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next 12 to 24 hours we will be migrating our router and cross connects in Luxembourg. Due to LuxConnect using a 3rd party to complete the fiber splicing, we can&amp;rsquo;t set an exact start time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To complete this work a full network outage must occur. The actual moving of the router upstairs should go quick since it&amp;rsquo;s a single unit, but given the delays we&amp;rsquo;ve had already I won&amp;rsquo;t promise any &amp;lsquo;completion&amp;rsquo; time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we can say is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luxconnect claims each XC will take around 10 minutes to splice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have 4 cross connects in this location so their side will take about an hour to complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;rsquo;t require all 4 cross connects to be completed for service to be restored. Although there will be high latency and poor speeds until the work is fully completed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Root really shouldn&amp;rsquo;t take more than 15 - 20 at the most to move that single unit as it&amp;rsquo;s quite light and doesn&amp;rsquo;t require 2 people. Famous last words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we see one of or links go down we&amp;rsquo;ll press on Root to start the router move ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we&amp;rsquo;re not on site to complete this work ourselves we&amp;rsquo;re at the mercy of our vendors. We&amp;rsquo;re sorry we can&amp;rsquo;t give concrete completion times.&lt;/p&gt;

Update Regarding the network interruption (~30 second) that occurred during the Ashburn maintenance we do appologise for any inconvenience, particularly those in other regions adversely affected that should not have been involved in this maintenance. Clearly we did not intend for this response and will be investigating a fix for the faulty module ASAP which will be deployed before any other hardware upgrades are completed.</description>

Investigating - We have narrowed the issue down to outgoing routes going over Cogent in two locations (AMS &amp;amp; LAX)
Identified - Cogent activated uRPF (without notice) on our upstream ports (2 PoPs) leading to an interruption as we don&amp;rsquo;t use Cogent for Ingress but they are used (if they are the best route) for Egress selectively.</description>
