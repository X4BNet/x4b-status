However all XCs are now up and services online for over half an hour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUpdate\u003c/strong\u003e Some routes are back. Some XCs are not yet spliced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpstream network provider has announced a maintenenace affecting Lux customers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ndash;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe apologize about the short notice (again).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the next 12 to 24 hours we will be migrating our router and cross connects in Luxembourg. Due to LuxConnect using a 3rd party to complete the fiber splicing, we can\u0026rsquo;t set an exact start time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo complete this work a full network outage must occur. The actual moving of the router upstairs should go quick since it\u0026rsquo;s a single unit, but given the delays we\u0026rsquo;ve had already I won\u0026rsquo;t promise any \u0026lsquo;completion\u0026rsquo; time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat we can say is this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuxconnect claims each XC will take around 10 minutes to splice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have 4 cross connects in this location so their side will take about an hour to complete.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe don\u0026rsquo;t require all 4 cross connects to be completed for service to be restored. Although there will be high latency and poor speeds until the work is fully completed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoot really shouldn\u0026rsquo;t take more than 15 - 20 at the most to move that single unit as it\u0026rsquo;s quite light and doesn\u0026rsquo;t require 2 people. Famous last words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce we see one of or links go down we\u0026rsquo;ll press on Root to start the router move ASAP.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince we\u0026rsquo;re not on site to complete this work ourselves we\u0026rsquo;re at the mercy of our vendors. We\u0026rsquo;re sorry we can\u0026rsquo;t give concrete completion times.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
