Only an acknowledgement of suspected fault on their end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are processing payments through our workaround as per normal. However there is still some element of unknown until paypal resolve the actual issue (which appears to be issues specifically with our x4b.net domain name)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs this issue does not have any known customer impact we are going to bring it to a close now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShould you experience any delayed payments (either immeidately, or after 3 hours when the new correlation script can recover any missed payments) via paypal let us know and we will sort it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eUpdate\u003c/em\u003e - Still yet to receive any solution from Paypal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur Transaction log check job remains in place.

We understand this is inconvenient however at this time it is what we have available to us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaypal\u0026rsquo;s IPN system has abruptly stopped communicating with us and we await a serious response from Paypal on this matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStripe (Credit Card) and Crypto payments are unaffected.
