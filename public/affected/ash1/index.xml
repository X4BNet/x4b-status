        <description>It is expected that maintenance will take approximately 1 hour per server. No interruption is expected however risk does exist. We will be updating a couple servers at a time.
There is the chance that we will need to do the update of some servers the following day. However the plan is to get all the servers done in one day if possible.
This is the same update that has already been performed on the budget line.</description>

        <description>Update We have made adjustments to the VLAN routing and have restored service in Ashburn.
Zayo maintenance on the dark fiber within the network is interrupting service. We are working on a temporary fix to re-route currently.
Routes have been pulled during the issue.</description>

        <description>As of this latest update we are marking this maintenance window as complete. If you are experiencing any issues please don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to open a support ticket.
Update Regarding the network interruption (~30 second) that occurred during the Ashburn maintenance we do appologise for any inconvenience, particularly those in other regions adversely affected that should not have been involved in this maintenance. Clearly we did not intend for this response and will be investigating a fix for the faulty module ASAP which will be deployed before any other hardware upgrades are completed.</description>
