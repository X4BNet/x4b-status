        <description>It is expected that maintenance will take approximately 1 hour per server. No interruption is expected however risk does exist. We will be updating a couple servers at a time.
There is the chance that we will need to do the update of some servers the following day. However the plan is to get all the servers done in one day if possible.
This is the same update that has already been performed on the budget line.</description>

        <description>Update Complete
We will be performing system upgrades on Wednesday. No interruption is expected.
Systems will be done in parallel in groups with an estimated total risk of interruption period per server of 30 minutes.
This is the same upgrade that was carried out on the budget line last week without interruption.
If any interruption or unexpected event occurs we will update this incident.</description>

        <description>Investigating - We are investigating a potential issue that might affect the uptime of one our of services. We are sorry for any inconvenience this may cause you. This incident post will be updated once we have more information. In order to test potential fixes to the issue we may need to restart services in this region.
We will attempt to keep interruption to a minimum.
Update - We have rebooted the system into a new kernel with a proposed fix.</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update&lt;/em&gt; - We have rebooted the system into a new kernel with a proposed fix. The underlying cause (potentially hardware) continues to be investigated. We beleive however that the action taken will prevent the issue from impacting reliability further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will keep this incident open and update it as matters progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update&lt;/em&gt; - The workaround applied yesterday has proven itself effective. We will keep the workaround applied at this time until the underlying [assumed] hardware issue can be resolved. We do not anticipate any further instability and will schedule maintenance as appropriate for the next step seperately.&lt;/p&gt;
