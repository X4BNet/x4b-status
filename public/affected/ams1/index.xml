        <description>It is expected that maintenance will take approximately 1 hour per server. No interruption is expected however risk does exist. We will be updating a couple servers at a time.
There is the chance that we will need to do the update of some servers the following day. However the plan is to get all the servers done in one day if possible.
This is the same update that has already been performed on the budget line.</description>

Update Appears to be a GTT fault. Fault ticket has been opened.
Update Investigation continues upstream. This issue only appears to affect Premium Anycast customers. Standard Anycast routes seem unaffected.
Investigating - We are investigating a potential issue that might affect the uptime of one our of services. It appears to be a bug in the upstream providers routing configuration.</description>

Systems will be done in parallel in groups with an estimated total risk of interruption period per server of 30 minutes.

        <description>Our upstream datacenter has notified us today of upcoming maintenance in Amsterdam.
Network engineers will be upgrading top-of-rack switches and reworking some of the network topologies for a more robust and stable overall network in the server cabinet.
Though the outage is not expected to last more than 5 to 10 minutes, the work window will be longer as our team will test and ensure connectivity is stable before completing the maintenance.</description>

        <description>Update Hardware has been replaced upstream and we have restored routes. Sorry for any interruption over the past 5 minutes we had a limited window for restoration while under the eye of upstream NOC today.
Update Upstream confirms that the issue is taking longer than expected to resolve. We continue to route around the issue.
Upstream has confirmed an interruption in AMS affecting firewalled TCP traffic. We have pulled routes from the region until incident confirmed over.</description>

Routes via AMS will be restored once we get a suitable response or stability has appeared to return.</description>

Investigating - We have narrowed the issue down to outgoing routes going over Cogent in two locations (AMS &amp;amp; LAX)
Identified - Cogent activated uRPF (without notice) on our upstream ports (2 PoPs) leading to an interruption as we don&amp;rsquo;t use Cogent for Ingress but they are used (if they are the best route) for Egress selectively.</description>

        <description>Investigating - It appears that the Emergency maintenance performed by upstream to resolve Amsterdam: Connectivity Issues has not been successful in resolving the ToR stability issue. We have seen what appears to be a similar interuption. We have pulled routes again and await upstream response.
Investigating - CPU spikes on upstream ToR switch. They have made some adjustments and continue to monitor. We have restored routes.
Fixed - Upstream reports fixed.</description>

        <description>We will be upgrading our network capacity and filtering hardware in Amsterdam. Any customers who have configured a HA type setup will be largely unaffected as routes will be removed from the region at-least 10 minutes before start of maintenance and traffic redirected to London and Ashburn PoPs.
We expect the total maintenance to take approx 1-hour.
Update - Maintenance taking a little longer than expected. Routes will be restored to Amsterdam as soon as possible.</description>
