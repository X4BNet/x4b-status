        <description>It is expected that maintenance will take approximately 1 hour per server. No interruption is expected however risk does exist. We will be updating a couple servers at a time.
There is the chance that we will need to do the update of some servers the following day. However the plan is to get all the servers done in one day if possible.
This is the same update that has already been performed on the budget line.</description>

        <description>﻿Update - At long last upstream has resolved the issue.
&amp;ldquo;One of the edge routers encountered issues due to a firmware bug. detecting the issue was challenging as no logs were generated, due to the router running outdated firmware. the issue was resolved by updating the RE code and rebooting the router.&amp;rdquo;
R﻿outes to LA have been restored.
Investigating - We have been investigating some issues this month in LA upstream.</description>

        <description>We are aware of issues with GTT routes at the transit level. These occur primarily from EU&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;US however some issues have been observed with other routes. We have contacted them for a comment however have not (as of yet) received one.

        <description>Investigating - We are investigating a potential issue that might affect the uptime of one our of services. We are sorry for any inconvenience this may cause you. This incident post will be updated once we have more information.
Investigating - We have narrowed the issue down to outgoing routes going over Cogent in two locations (AMS &amp;amp; LAX)
Identified - Cogent activated uRPF (without notice) on our upstream ports (2 PoPs) leading to an interruption as we don&amp;rsquo;t use Cogent for Ingress but they are used (if they are the best route) for Egress selectively.</description>
