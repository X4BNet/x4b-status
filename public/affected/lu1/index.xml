        <description>Luxembourg services are moving to Switzerland. Our upstream in the region is co-ordinating the move.
No substantial interruption is expected for the move as we will do a live migration.
Appologies for the short notice. While we knew this was planned we were not informed until just now of the exact details.</description>

        <description>Update No official all clear yet as work related to the move continues. However all XCs are now up and services online for over half an hour.
Update Some routes are back. Some XCs are not yet spliced.
Upstream network provider has announced a maintenenace affecting Lux customers.

We apologize about the short notice (again).
In the next 12 to 24 hours we will be migrating our router and cross connects in Luxembourg.</description>

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We apologize about the short notice (again).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next 12 to 24 hours we will be migrating our router and cross connects in Luxembourg. Due to LuxConnect using a 3rd party to complete the fiber splicing, we can&amp;rsquo;t set an exact start time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To complete this work a full network outage must occur. The actual moving of the router upstairs should go quick since it&amp;rsquo;s a single unit, but given the delays we&amp;rsquo;ve had already I won&amp;rsquo;t promise any &amp;lsquo;completion&amp;rsquo; time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we can say is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luxconnect claims each XC will take around 10 minutes to splice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have 4 cross connects in this location so their side will take about an hour to complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;rsquo;t require all 4 cross connects to be completed for service to be restored. Although there will be high latency and poor speeds until the work is fully completed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Root really shouldn&amp;rsquo;t take more than 15 - 20 at the most to move that single unit as it&amp;rsquo;s quite light and doesn&amp;rsquo;t require 2 people. Famous last words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we see one of or links go down we&amp;rsquo;ll press on Root to start the router move ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we&amp;rsquo;re not on site to complete this work ourselves we&amp;rsquo;re at the mercy of our vendors. We&amp;rsquo;re sorry we can&amp;rsquo;t give concrete completion times.&lt;/p&gt;
