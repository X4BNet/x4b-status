        <description>Update We have restored Equinix SG IX. Issue was an incorrect route policy upstream. Upstream has issued a fix. We will be continuing to monitor the situation for any regression.
Update We have made adjustments temporarily reducing the traffic going to SG but preventing route over-reach. We await the IX fix.
Update we are awaiting upstream response on this matter
We are aware of some (HE) traffic on the Premium Line from around the world arriving in Signapore.</description>

&lt;p&gt;We are aware of some (HE) traffic on the Premium Line from around the world arriving in Signapore. This appears to be due to a BGP bug in Equinix IX (Singapore). We are working with our upstreams on it.&lt;/p&gt;
