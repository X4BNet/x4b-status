        <description>It is expected that maintenance will take approximately 1 hour per server. No interruption is expected however risk does exist. We will be updating a couple servers at a time.
There is the chance that we will need to do the update of some servers the following day. However the plan is to get all the servers done in one day if possible.
This is the same update that has already been performed on the budget line.</description>

Systems will be done in parallel in groups with an estimated total risk of interruption period per server of 30 minutes.

Update Server has been installed in the new DC. Just waiting on some network updates to be made before routes can be made live.
Update Server de-racking has begun. Due to the risk of reboots as fibers are moved we have decided that we will be removing routes until the hazard is cleared. Routes have already been removed in advance of our sever being de-racked.</description>

&lt;p&gt;O﻿ur server will be getting physically moved to a new datacenter between these dates. This will help us combat issues observed over the past few months including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;﻿- Increased temperature within the cage our server is in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;﻿- Replacement of a failing switch (this has been responsible for a few 5-10s per week interruptions over the past month)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E﻿xpected interuption is likely just a couple hours, however depending on when we get scheduled we may restrict routes before / after depending on the availability of our technicians to verify / prepare. We are relying on remote hands and a significant number of servers are being moved during this time so we do not at this stage know our exact time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;W﻿e will aim to revise the scheduled time however to reduce the range closer to the event.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>﻿Update** LON1 is being restored to the mix. Upstream techs have been able to repair the existing switch (replaced fan). We have monitored the switch for the past 48-hours after fan replacement and has been reliable.
&amp;ldquo;We observed that the onsite fans were ineffective, but the replacement fan we dispatched has proven successful. At present, the switch seems to be operating reliably, and we&amp;rsquo;ve been actively monitoring its performance.&amp;quot;</description>

We are currently in the process of onboarding our new (replacement) transit provider Lumen (formerly Level3). Originally lit only for APAC and South America Lumen transit has now been lit for US and EU PoPs with one exception.
W﻿e are currently waiting on transit availability in London (Globalswitch). Due to the close pysical location and significant advantage in lighting Lumen accross EU and US at this time we have opted to proceed before London is ready.</description>
