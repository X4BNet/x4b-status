        <description>It is expected that maintenance will take approximately 1 hour per server. No interruption is expected however risk does exist. We will be updating a couple servers at a time.
There is the chance that we will need to do the update of some servers the following day. However the plan is to get all the servers done in one day if possible.
This is the same update that has already been performed on the budget line.</description>
